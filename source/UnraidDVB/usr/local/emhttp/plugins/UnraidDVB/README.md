**unRAID DVB Edition**

This plugin from linuxserver.io allows you to easily install a modified unRAID version with DVB drivers compiled.  
Remember to add --device=/dev/dvb to the extra parameters in any docker container.(Already present for Sat-ip)

There are three versions available:  
* LibreELEC for most DVB cards.  
* TBS (OpenSource) for TBS cards.  
* Digital Devices Github for Digital Devices cards.  

Once installed you can then use several different docker containers or plugins to use unRAID as a PVR backend.  
Links are provided to useful threads on the plugin page.
